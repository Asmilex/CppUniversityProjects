# Year one: getting the basics
## First triannual 
It mainly focuses on common programming concepts, such as conditionals, loops, arrays (using the `vector class`) and pretty simple classes. 
`Classwork` follows the book [Fundamentos de Programación con la STL](https://www.casadellibro.com/libro-fundamentos-de-programacion-con-la-stl/9788433859174/3041048), and `Home` our teacher's presentation. Although, they are fairly simple exercices

## Second triannual
This term introduces dynamic memory, C-arrays,  file handling and progresses in `classes`. the most interesting part is the `practicar` folder.
DGIIM Souls is a WIP project that will not get finished, most likely ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
